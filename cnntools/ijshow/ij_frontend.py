"""Show image using Fiji backend.

Basics
------

This package uses Fiji to display :obj:`numpy.array`. Temporary folder is used as intermediate transport medium, each
array is saved as *tiff* image before displaying and then *Fiji* is called with this file as parameter. A
reference (as file name) to displayed image is returned back to the caller allowing to re-read this image after
modification i *Fiji*. There is random folder created in system *tmp* on each new :class:`IJShow` object.
This solution is rather recommended to be used with IPython.

Usage
-----

Example:
    d
